  # All this month my main work was this project. From the very beginning, as soon as this idea came 
  # into my mind, I immediately began to think about how this project would look like and what features 
  # it would contain. I wanted to do everything at once, and I still want to.

  # Before that, I had worked on projects without a backend and the connection between backend
  # and frontend had been not entirely clear to me. This project allowed me to look deeper into this topic. 
  # I would like to spend more time on this project than I had. There is still so much more I can add to it.

  # The hardest part was getting the grip of how the Blizzard API works. Their manuals are not very 
  # detailed, so everything was trial and error. And now, a month later, I already see some things that 
  # should have been done differently. I also realize now the importance and the complexity of planning
  # the architecture beforehand. A nice approach to it allows for much easier implementation and
  # scaling of the project at its later stages. Another important topic that I had to work on was
  # testing. It's very easy to miss some detail and break some old functionality while working on 
  # something new. Therefore I've felt that a systematic approach to regression testing is quite important.

  # The experience that I gained while writing this project will allow me to think ahead of the project 
  # architecture in the future, which will allow me to quickly make improvements and add new features.
   
  # I really enjoyed working on it and I think that in my free time I will continue to improve it.
